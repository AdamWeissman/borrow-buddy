# Project Title

## Description

### The What

<!-- A little info about your project and/or overview that explains **what** the project is about. -->

### The Why

<!-- A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists. -->

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

<!-- What things you need to install the software and how to install them

### Installation

<!-- A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running -->

Fork [this repository](<!-- link to repo -->) from GitHub and clone your forked copy down to your computer. Open a new terminal window and `cd` into the <!-- `repo name` --> root directory.

List any other actions needed to be taken before starting up the server.

<!-- **Steps for a Ruby on Rails app with PostgreSQL**
Create a new file by typing `touch .env` and input the following text into this file:

```
POSTGRES_USER=YOUR_USERNAME
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD
POSTGRES_HOST='localhost'
POSTGRES_DB='[repo-name]'
POSTGRES_TEST_DB='[repo-name]_test'
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your computer's username—the name used in your terminal's root path (`$PATH`), or what you see when you type `PWD` in your terminal (i.e. `Users/yourname/`)—in single quotes and `YOUR_PASSWORD` with whatever you want it to be, again in single quotes.

Type `bundle install` into the terminal to load all of the Ruby Gems and dependencies into your app. Start up the PostgreSQL server and type `rails db:setup` into the terminal. This allows PostgreSQL to create two new databases (development and test) using the `.env` file you just created in the [App Name] app (in addition to pre-existing configurations). Next, type `rails db:migrate`. This step runs the table migrations in the app, which gives the database instructions on what kind of data it should look to receive and to which models and attributes the data corresponds.

To start up the Rails server, which is in charge of rendering your app on the web, therefore allowing users to interact with it, type `rails s` in the terminal. You should now be able to open up a new browser window and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and see the [App Name] homepage displayed. From there, either log in or sign up and have fun!

When you're done, just type `Ctrl + C` in the terminal to stop your Rails session and remember to also shut down your PostgreSQL server. If you'd like to reset the database to delete any objects you've created and start over fresh, type `rails db:reset` into the terminal. -->

## Usage

<!-- End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo -->

<!-- **If I have a demo video**
I recorded a quick demo video (below) on how to use [App Name].

[![[App Name] demo video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/[link to YouTube video]/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/[link to YouTube video]) -->

<!-- **Steps for a Ruby on Rails app with PostgreSQL**
I also created a seed file which holds randomized data to use specifically for app development and testing purposes. If you'd like to explore [App Name] with data preloaded into the database, type `rails db:seed` in the terminal and log in using the following credentials:

```
